May 20, 2019 First commit.  This is a work in progress, so don't expect anything in this limited edition to make it to production.
August 1, 2019  Full Version for Beta testing.  This version makes extensive use of plotly charts, and relies upon plotly interface for chart downloads.  This version allows for downloads of charts and datasets, no formatted tables or summary report.  Rendeing of version can be slow.  Am investigating ways to speed this up.

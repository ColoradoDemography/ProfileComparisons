This is the first iteration of version 2 of the Colorado Demographics Profile Dashboard
This version changes the way images and tables are displyed.  Objects are written to temporary files when they are generated 
and then these temporary files are loaded as needed.  This speeds up the production of the report.

The code for the report has also been changed to prevent the issues of outputting incorrect geographies
